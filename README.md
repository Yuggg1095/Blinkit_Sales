Blinkit Sales Analysis and Prediction

üìà Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting sales for Blinkit using Python and Power BI.
We performed end-to-end data processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, and visualization to extract meaningful insights and forecast future sales trends.

üõ† Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels)

Machine Learning Models:

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor

Linear Regression

ARIMA (for time series forecasting)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Power BI (for data visualization and dashboard creation)

Jupyter Notebook (for development and analysis)

Git/GitHub (for version control)

üîç Key Steps
Data Collection & Cleaning
Prepared and preprocessed sales data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Identified sales patterns, trends, seasonality, and correlations using visualizations.

Feature Engineering
Created new relevant features to improve model performance.

Model Building & Evaluation
Trained multiple regression and time series models, evaluated using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R¬≤ Score.

Visualization & Reporting
Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize sales trends, model comparisons, and business insights.

üìä Power BI Dashboard
The project includes a fully interactive Power BI dashboard displaying:

Sales trends over time

Regional and product-wise performance

Forecasted sales using ML models

Key metrics and KPIs for business decision-making

‚ú® Future Improvements
Hyperparameter tuning for better model performance

Deployment of best model with a real-time dashboard

Incorporation of additional external factors (e.g., holidays, promotions)
